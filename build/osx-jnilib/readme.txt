This is current versions of native bluecove libraries compatible only with current bluecove code in svn
This libraries are taken by Linux build server to produce bluecove-$VERSION$-SNAPSHOT.jar

The custom build native libraries for released versions can be taken from http://snapshot.bluecove.org/special-build/
If required the standard native libraries for released versions should extracted from distribution bluecove-$VERSION$.jar

Idealy the libraries in this and special-build directory should be produced by bluecove build server running on Windows XP in VMware-player on the main pyx4j.com Linux build server.
The only problem is that Mac OS X Leo does not run under VMware for me But this may change soon.
