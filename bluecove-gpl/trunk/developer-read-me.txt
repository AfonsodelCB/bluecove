* Build maven2

   The project is a module for bluecove project.

   We are using maven2 to download main bluecove.jar and build this project.

   To create Eclipse projects run:
     mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true

   To run build without tests:
     mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true

   To run build without building native code:
     mvn -Dnative.build.skip=true

* Build using ant

    For your convenience you may use ant to create the librayr binary and jar

    For this main bluecove.jar should be download or compiled, expected location is: ../bluecove/target/bluecove-${version}.jar

    To build native library libbluecove-${os.arch}.so and bluecove-gpl-${version}.jar:
        ant all

* Native Library Compilation Requirements

    - GCC compiler (4.1 or newer)
    - Java SE Development Kit 1.4 or newer
    - Linux Bluetooth protocol stack (BlueZ)
    - Development librararies for Bluetooth applications (package bluez-libs-devel 3.9 or newer)
    - When building on 64-bit platform make sure JAVA_HOME during build is pointing to 64-bit java

    The native library are build during maven or ant build.
